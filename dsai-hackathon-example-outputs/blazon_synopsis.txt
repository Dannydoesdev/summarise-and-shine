Hey there, fellow AI enthusiasts! I'm so excited to share with you an amazing video I recently watched, which introduces Blazon, a startup revolutionizing the AI landscape with its no-code development platform and prepackaged software components.

In the video, Jesse showcases Blazon's two main offerings: Blazon capabilities, a software package with an API for seamless integration, and multi-flow, a low-code workflow building tool. One of the most impressive demonstrations is the structured synthesis feature that extracts financial metrics from an NVIDIA earnings call snippet - imagine the potential applications!

The capabilities API allows users to extract metrics efficiently and supports Python and TypeScript. But the best part? It's open-source and free for up to 100,000 API requests per month.

The video doesn't stop there; it takes us through building a research tool that helps users become experts on any topic using Blazon's capabilities. They suggest creating a master plan with brainstorming, curriculums, and using Wikipedia search functions. Vector search and search abstractions library are also introduced, opening up endless possibilities.

The process of creating a search index for a Wikipedia subset is explained, and the video emphasizes the importance of having a business use case for hackathon submissions while exploring various applications in finance, law, education, and more.

Lastly, the importance of verifying AI outputs and providing supporting passages for answers is discussed, with a demonstration of the document question answering endpoint.

So, if you're as excited as I am about building new tools with AI, I highly recommend checking out Blazon's capabilities for your research. If you need more information, feel free to reach out to the speakers. Happy hacking!
