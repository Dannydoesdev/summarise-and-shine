Hi everyone! I'm here to give you a summary of the DSAI Hackathon Youtube video. In this video, Dave Glover from Microsoft talks about open AI and chat GPT, and another speaker discusses the evolution of AI from expert systems to generative AI. They explain the potential for innovation with advanced models becoming the new compute platform, and the collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI in developing advanced AI systems. They also demonstrate the use of AI models in application platforms like Power BI and discuss the range of services offered by Microsoft. They emphasize the importance of responsible AI and how Microsoft is committed to ensuring its AI models are ethical and unbiased. Lastly, they discuss the importance of data privacy and security in AI models, and how Azure OpenAI service allows users to create an instance of a model in their own tenant for secure data interaction.
