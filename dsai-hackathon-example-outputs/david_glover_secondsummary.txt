In this section of the DSAI hackathon video, Dave Glover, a principal cloud advocate from Microsoft, gives a presentation on open AI and chat GPT. He explains the history of AI research and breakthroughs leading up to the development of chat GPT, and the potential for innovation in this area. Glover introduces the four families of models that can be deployed into Azure, including GPT-3, chat GPT, Codex, and DALI. He also discusses the potential of these models for improving customer experiences and communication with AI models. Glover then talks about the importance of responsible AI and the need for private and inclusive data, accountability, transparency, fairness, and safety. Finally, he explains the need for a range of AI solutions to build an overall solution, and gives some use cases such as call center analytics, content generation, and semantic search.

In section 12 of the DSAI hackathon YouTube video, Dave explains how Azure OpenAI can be used to extract information from various sources and customize it to respond to prompts. He also demonstrates how it can be used to create AI superheroes and provides tips on mitigating against hallucinations and confabulation. He then explains the Azure for Students program and confirms that anyone can use Azure, including children. Finally, he invites the team to come to the table in the corner to receive active schemes and get active people created for the team.
