The video ends by discussing responsible AI and how organizations are using AI to be more productive. The speaker gives an example of Microsoft Tay, an AI model that was released in 2016 and was taken down shortly after due to its inappropriate behavior. The speaker emphasizes the importance of responsible AI and how Microsoft is committed to ensuring that its AI models are ethical and unbiased.

In this section of the DSAI hackathon video, the speaker discusses the importance of responsible AI and the potential biases that can be introduced into AI models. The speaker highlights Microsoft's initiative on Responsible AI and its six principles, including the need for private and inclusive data, accountability, transparency, fairness, and safety. The speaker also discusses how Microsoft is providing tools and processes to help organizations build responsible AI models, such as content filtering and a responsible AI dashboard. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the importance of trust in data usage and highlights how Azure OpenAI service allows users to create an instance of a model in their own tenant for secure data interaction.

In this section of the DSAI hackathon video, the speaker discusses the importance of data privacy and security in AI models. They emphasize that the data used to train the models is held in encrypted storage and is not used by the organization to enhance the models. The speaker also notes that while OpenAI is a good choice for general purpose models, organizations have complex needs that require a range of AI solutions to build an overall solution. They provide some use cases such as call center analytics, content generation, and semantic search. The speaker also talks about a scenario where paper forms are still prevalent and explains how AI can be used to process and search through these documents.

In section 7 of the DSAI hackathon youtube video, the speaker discusses the use of Azure OpenAI and how it can be customized to extract information from various sources such as emails, forms, and call centers. The speaker recommends using Chat GPT as a default model and suggests downgrading to a cheaper model if necessary. They also mention that GPT models are currently based in the US and Western Europe, but will likely be made more widely available in the future. The speaker explains key terms such as prompts, context, and tokens and provides a demo of the Azure OpenAI Playground, showing how adding more context to a prompt can change the response from the model. Overall, the section provides an overview of how Azure OpenAI can be customized to extract information and respond to prompts.

In this section of the DSAI hackathon YouTube video, the speaker discusses how OpenAI models can be trained to act as a marketing assistant. By setting context and prompts, the model can be instructed to behave like a marketing expert and provide strategies and ideas for marketing a product. The speaker also explains how chat completions and system messages can be used to extract entities from a conversation and structure the information in a more useful format. The video also demonstrates how the conversation can be replayed back to the OpenAI model and how the playground provides sample code for implementing the conversation in an application.

In this section of the DSAI hackathon YouTube video, the speaker demonstrates how chat GPT models can be trained to behave like a SQL server. He shows a demo where he asks the model to execute SQL commands and it responds back with appropriate results. The speaker emphasizes that context matters and telling the model what to behave as is important. He then moves on to show a demo of DALI, a model that can be used to create pop art-style superheroes. He explains how he used this model for a content campaign and how it can be used for various creative applications.

In this section, the speaker demonstrates how to generate AI superheroes using text-based models. He explains that it is possible to nudge the models to create diverse superheroes with different ages, skin colors, and identities. He also suggests that these models can be used in applications and encourages viewers to use their imagination. The speaker then concludes his talk by providing some tips on how to mitigate against hallucinations and confabulation when using AI models.
